Much more intricate calculations. 

A company needs to print pay-slips for its employees. 

Each record contains the following: number, name, hours, gender, code.

Each employeeâ€™s gross pay must be calculated and deductions made on the following basis:

 

CODE 1:  Full-time employee rate: R30 per hour

Deductions:          

Men PAYE: 15% of gross pay. Medical aid R200
Women PAYE: 10% of gross pay. Medical aid R100
 

CODE 2: Part-time employee rate: R20 per hour

Deductions:  

Men PAYE: 10% of gross pay
Women PAYE: 5% of gross pay
No medical aid for this category
Print out a pay-slip for each employee, showing all the employee details, gross pay, all the deductions and the net pay.  Processing continues until a number of 0 is entered. 

After all of the records have been processed, print the following:

The total number of men who work full-time.
The total PAYE paid by women.
The total amount paid out by the company to all its employees.
